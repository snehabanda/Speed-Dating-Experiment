The research is a part of an experimental study, conducted to identify differences in mate selection for both the genders. The data has been generated from a speed dating experiment conducted with independent measures. The primary question of interest is to determine if the factors influencing the dating preferences are different for men and women.  
From a group of volunteers, subjects have been selected at random and were made to experience 4-minute dates. At the end of the speed date, subjects were made to fill up a closed ended questionnaire, having to rate the participant on six pre-defined parameters and whether they would like to go on a second date or not. 
Our research suggests that the factors influencing dating behavior of men and women are different. Men prefer women who are attractive, intelligent and fun to be with. They do not prefer women who are more intelligent than themselves and also ambitious. 
On the other hand, women prefer men who are fun to be with, intelligent and have mutually common interests.
